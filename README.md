## Development server

If you have @Angular/cli installed, once you clone down this repo run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

If you don't, just run `npm install -g @angular/cli` (might have to run w/ sudo) - More info here: https://angular.io/cli

If you don't have `npm` installed, may God have mercy on your soul

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
